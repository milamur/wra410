# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. In the style.css file, I changed the background color of the pages from white to beige (#E7DABD) by editing the code in the #container div.  

2. In the style.css file, I changed the font to 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua' as well as the sans-serif to a serif by editing the font-family code in the body. 

3. I included images on two of the html files, including contact.html and assignments.html. On contacts.html, I included an image at the bottom of the page by saving it in my wra410 directory, using "<img src = "xxx">" and coding the width and the height in my text editor. I did the same for the image I added to assignments.html. 

4. I added a table in assignments.html to format the grading scale at the bottom by coding <table></table> and organizing it with <tr></tr> and <td></td>. I chose a width as well. 

5. I reformatted the groups page by changing the color of the links on the groups.html file to MSU green and separated each student name with commas so that it looks cleaner.  

6. I added the navigation bar to schedule.html by mirroring it with the navigation bar that's consistent throughout the rest of the site. I included it at the beginning of the code under the title. 

7. I revised the rows and columns on the schedule webpage by realigning and reformatting some of the content, specifically when the topic as well as the links included in the middle column were redundant. For example, in the CRUD section, "CRUD" was repeated twice since both the topic and the link included that word. So I removed the topic and kept the link, making this page cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing. I also separated the week with the dates in the lefthand column for organizational purposes.
